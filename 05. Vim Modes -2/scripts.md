# Text manipulation operations in Visual mode


## Visual mode intro
Visual mode is an advanced mode in vim and can be used for navigation and manipulation of text selections

It allows the use of most Normal mode commands on selected text
 

In this scenario, we are going to install some vim plugins to change the visual appearance of vim, to be able to better understand how modes are functioning:

git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/amix/vimrc.git ~/.vim_runtime
sh ~/.vim_runtime/install_awesome_vimrc.sh
